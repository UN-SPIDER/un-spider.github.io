<p>Wildfires can result in the loss of human life and influence different ecological processes as they partially or completely remove the vegetation layer. Therefore, it is essential to assess the severity of the impacted area. This Recommended Practice was developed to help contribute to the assessment of areas affected by wildfires. This Python version combines the use of Sentinel-2 pre- and post-fire satellite imagery and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index. The Recommended Practice was designed specifically to assess large areas.</p>
